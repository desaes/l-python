# Named tuples provide a quick way to define simple classes. The drawback is that simple
# classes donâ€™t always stay simple. You might decide later that you want to add methods
# to a named tuple. In that case, you could define a new class that inherits from the named
# tuple:

class Pointier(Point):
    pass
    # add more methods here
